Description: frameR is a workflow that takes PRIDICT2.0 .csv outputs in a directory and binds them together into a dataframe. frameR then formats a reporter sequence or 'pseudo target' for use in measuring editing efficiency of the pegRNA in high-throughput screens. frameR can also be used to filter pegRNAs for library generation, to create matched controls installing the reference allele, and to format final oligos for ordering in a pooled format.
